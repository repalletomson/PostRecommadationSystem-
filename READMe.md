# Hybrid Recommendation System

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system to suggest the top 3 posts for each user based on user profile information, past engagement data, and post attributes.

## Project Structure

The project is implemented as a Colab notebook. The key components are:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loading the user, post, and engagement data from CSV files and performing initial data validation and exploration.
2.  **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Cleaning the data, extracting relevant features (like interests and tags), and creating interaction features (like positive engagement counts).
3.  **Content-Based Filtering**: Building a content-based component using TF-IDF on post tags and calculating cosine similarity between posts.
4.  **Collaborative Filtering**: Creating a user-item interaction matrix from the engagement data.
5.  **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Combining the content-based and collaborative filtering approaches using a weighted sum of scores.
6.  **Recommendation Generation**: Generating the top 3 post recommendations for each user based on the hybrid scores.
7.  **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like Precision@k, Recall@k, and Mean Average Precision (MAP).
## Approach

The recommendation system employs a hybrid approach combining:

*   **Content-Based Filtering**: Leverages the similarity of post tags using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
*   **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user-item engagement patterns from the historical data.

A weighted sum is used to combine the scores from both components, allowing for tuning the influence of each method.

## Evaluation

The performance of the recommendation system is evaluated using standard top-N recommendation metrics:

*   **Precision@k**: Measures the accuracy of the top `k` recommendations.
*   **Recall@k**: Measures the coverage of relevant items within the top `k` recommendations.
*   **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**: A ranking-aware metric that considers the order of relevant items.

For this project, `k=3` was used, and positive engagements (`engagement == 1`) were considered the ground truth for relevance.

The notebook outputs the top 3 recommendations for each user and the calculated evaluation metrics (Average Precision@3, Average Recall@3, and MAP).

**Mean Average Precision (MAP):** 0.0370

**Average Precision@3**: 0.1733
**Average Recall@3**: 0.0511

## Potential Extensions

Several potential extensions could be explored to improve the recommendation system:

*   Incorporating more features (user demographics, content type, time of engagement, creator info).
*   Exploring advanced collaborative filtering techniques (Matrix Factorization, Deep Learning models).
*   Implementing different hybrid strategies (weighted ranking, switching, model-based).
*   Addressing the cold start problem for new users and items.
*   Conducting online evaluation (A/B testing).
*   Adding explainability to the recommendations.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

*   pandas
*   numpy
*   sklearn
*   scipy
